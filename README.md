# Yatri Sakha

This project was developed for the **Smart India Hackathon 2024 Prelims** under problem statement **PS-1711**. The aim of the project was to
enhance the Rail Madad app by integrating an AI chatbot to filter complaints based on the sector they belong to such as healthcare, maintenance,
security, etc. and based on their priority level, such as Urgent, High Priority, or Low Priority.

This project was **ranked 2nd in the Hackathon**. It was built using **EJS & CSS** for the frontend, **Node.js and Express.js** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for data storage.
